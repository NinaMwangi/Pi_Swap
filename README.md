##Problem Statement
The rising cost of living, poor economic conditions, and limited resources have necessitated the need for a more sustainable and affordable way of acquiring school-going childrenâ€™s books. The current second-hand market has tried to bridge the gap however, the existing platforms and traditional markets have fallen short due to factors such as accessibility and trust.

## Dataset
The dataset used is from the current KLB approved book list from pre primary level to tertiary level.
